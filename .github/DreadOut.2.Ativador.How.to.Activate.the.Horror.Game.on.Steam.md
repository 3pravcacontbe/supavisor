## DreadOut 2 Tips and Tricks: How to Survive the Horror Game
 
DreadOut 2 is not an easy game. You will face many dangers and challenges as you explore the haunted locations and fight the evil spirits. You will need to be smart, resourceful, and brave to make it through the game. Here are some tips and tricks that might help you survive DreadOut 2:

- Use your smartphone wisely. Your smartphone is your main tool for detecting and banishing ghosts. You can use it to scan your surroundings, take pictures of clues, and snap photos of intangible ghosts to damage them. However, your smartphone has a limited battery life, so you need to conserve it as much as possible. You can recharge it by finding power outlets or using power banks, but they are scarce and hard to find. You can also switch to different camera modes, such as night vision or infrared, to see better in the dark or reveal hidden secrets.
- Don't forget your weapons. Besides your smartphone, you can also use melee weapons and projectiles to fight physical ghosts. You can find various weapons throughout the game, such as axes, knives, crowbars, pipes, hammers, scissors, and more. You can also throw objects at ghosts, such as bottles, cans, bricks, rocks, etc. However, your weapons have durability and can break after repeated use. You can repair them by finding repair kits or using duct tape, but they are also rare and limited. You can also switch between different weapons by pressing the Q key or using the mouse wheel.
- Explore every corner. DreadOut 2 is a game that rewards exploration. You can find many useful items and secrets by searching every nook and cranny of the game world. You can find health items, such as bandages, pills, or herbs, to heal yourself when you are injured. You can find collectibles, such as coins, notes, photos, or comics, to learn more about the game's lore and unlock achievements. You can also find hidden stages and mini-bosses that offer extra challenges and rewards. You can also interact with NPCs and complete side quests that can give you hints or help you progress in the game.
- Save often. DreadOut 2 does not have an auto-save feature. You need to manually save your game by finding save points or using save tokens. Save points are marked by red candles that you can light up with your lighter. Save tokens are items that you can use to create a temporary save point anywhere in the game. However, both save points and save tokens are limited and hard to come by. You need to use them wisely and strategically to avoid losing your progress or having to repeat difficult sections of the game.
- Be prepared for boss fights. DreadOut 2 features some of the most terrifying boss spirits that you will ever encounter in a horror game. These boss spirits are based on Asian/Indonesian urban legends and myths, such as the Kuntilanak, the Gore Surgeon, the Pocong King, and more. Each boss spirit has its own unique appearance, behavior, attack pattern, weakness, and strategy. You need to study their movements and patterns carefully and use your smartphone and weapons effectively to defeat them. Some boss fights also require you to solve puzzles or perform certain actions to trigger their vulnerability.

DreadOut 2 is a game that will test your courage and skills as a ghost hunter. It is a game that will make you scream, jump, laugh, cry, and feel a range of emotions as you experience its thrilling story and gameplay. It is a game that will leave you breathless and satisfied once you finish it. If you are ready for a horror adventure like no other, DreadOut 2 is the game for you.
