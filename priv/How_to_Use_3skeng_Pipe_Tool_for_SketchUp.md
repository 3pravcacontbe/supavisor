## Conceptual Mode
 
The conceptual mode of 3skeng Pipe Tool lets you create pipes, fittings and accessories with just a few clicks. You can choose from different standards (ANSI, ASME, ISO EN and JIS) and dimensions for your components. You can also use magnetic points and memory functions to help you align and connect your elements smoothly.
 
To use the conceptual mode, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Pipe Tool icon from the 3skeng toolbar.
2. Choose a standard and a dimension from the drop-down menus in the 3skeng client.
3. Click on a point in the model space to start drawing a pipe segment.
4. Move your mouse to adjust the length and direction of the pipe segment. You can also type a value in the VCB (value control box) to set the exact length.
5. Click again to finish the pipe segment. You can continue drawing more segments by repeating steps 3 and 4.
6. To add a fitting (such as a T-piece, Y-piece, reducer or elbow), click on the end of a pipe segment and choose a fitting from the pop-up menu. You can also use the arrow keys to cycle through the available fittings.
7. To edit or delete a pipe segment or a fitting, select it and use the tools in the 3skeng client or the context menu.

## Detail Mode
 
The detail mode of 3skeng Pipe Tool allows you to use libraries with dimensions that are available on the market. You can access detailed pipe libraries on the library page of 3skeng website. The detail mode also features an auto-pipe function that helps you connect 3skeng components automatically and select one of the possible configurations.
 
To use the detail mode, follow these steps:

1. Select the Pipe Tool icon from the 3skeng toolbar.
2. Switch to detail mode in the 3skeng client by clicking on the toggle button.
3. Choose a library from the drop-down menu in the 3skeng client.
4. Click on a point in the model space to start drawing a pipe segment.
5. Move your mouse to adjust the length and direction of the pipe segment. You can also type a value in the VCB to set the exact length.
6. Click again to finish the pipe segment. You can continue drawing more segments by repeating steps 4 and 5.
7. To add a fitting (such as a flange, elbow, tee or valve), click on the end of a pipe segment and choose a fitting from the pop-up menu. You can also use the arrow keys to cycle through the available fittings.
8. To connect two 3skeng components with auto-pipe, select them both and click on the auto-pipe button in the 3skeng client. You can also use the arrow keys to cycle through the possible configurations.
9. To edit or delete a pipe segment or a fitting, select it and use the tools in the 3skeng client or the context menu.

## Conclusion
 
3skeng Pipe Tool is an extension for SketchUp that makes 3D piping design easy and fun. You can use it to create conceptual or detailed piping systems with different standards and dimensions. You can also use magnetic points, memory functions and auto-pipe features to help you connect your components seamlessly.
